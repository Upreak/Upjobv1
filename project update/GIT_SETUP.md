## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Reminders**:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. **Database Credentials**: Use environment variables for database connections
3. **API Keys**: Store all API keys in environment variables
4. **Test Credentials**: Change default passwords before production deployment
5. **Git Security**: Use SSH keys for repository access when possible
